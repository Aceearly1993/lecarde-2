- CUTSCENES/ENDINGS

P1:
After vanquishing the evil looming over Rome, Efrain Lecarde journeyed to France.

P2:
Darkness has engulfed the Duchy of Guillecourt. The common people speak of day turning into night and about inhuman creatures lurking in the shadows. Terror has found a home in their hearts, where faith once lived.

P3:
One night, during his journey, a vision materialized before Efrain's eyes. A damsel overtaken by sorrow asked for his help, vanishing into the night just as suddenly as she had appeared. Who could she be? Does she know anything about the misery of the populace?

P4:
The Duchy of Guillecourt is formed by three earldoms: Servigny, La Tourvelle and Albaret. 

P5:
After many days and nights, Efrain reached Sevigny, where the most important mission of his life was about to begin...

P6:
Unable to stop the unholy summoning of Lucifer, Efrain met his demise within the depths of the Castle of Eternal Night. His fight against evil lost, Efrain's heroism amounted to dust in the wind.

P7:
Efrain's name was soon forgotten by the many years of bloodshed and destruction to follow. Evil was eventually repelled by other knights of the Church, but the long lost Lecarde name was not part of this legacy...

P8:
After a fierce struggle inside the Castle of Eternal Night, Efrain narrowly escaped the collapsing lair. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for Christine...

P9:
With Duke Guillecourt's successful summoning of Lucifer, many years of bloodshed soon followed. But along with other knights of the Church, Efrain managed to repel the forces of darkness.

P10:
Efrain's effort was remembered and honored, but at the cost of countless lives. No honor could spare Efrain from the anguish tormenting him until the last of his days. If only he had stopped the summoning of Lucifer all those years before...

P11:
With the defeat of Lucifer, the evil threatening to swallow the world was finally vanquished. Following the relentless battle, the morning sun welcomed Efrain to rest with Christine.

P12:
A bird appeared on the horizon, and brought the knight a message. It was a letter from Alucard.
Lecarde

You are a mighty warrior indeed and worthy of my trust. I have returned to my slumber, but I have something to ask of you. 

The search for my stolen sword took me many places. During my travels I encountered a Doctor bent on defying mortality. I fear if left unchecked, he will become a threat to mankind.

I have left you with directions to my chamber. Travel there to return my sword to me. There will be another powerful weapon waiting there for you. 

Godspeed Lecarde. 

Your friend,

Alucard

P13:
After reporting his quest in Rome, Efrain began his search for Alucard's chamber. Efrain Lecarde's name will forever be engraved in the pages of history.

- villages et villes

P1:
Beyond the forest there is an Inn called "L'Auberge rouge". I'd say it's better to not enter that place.

P2:
There are fields riddled with BLACK LOTUS flowers far to the east. That flower can disrupt your orientation. 


P3:
Hello! Are you using your map? You'll not want to get lost, will you?

P4:
Time has been stopped in 3  places on the duchy!

P5:
Count Servigny's mansion. The Convent Sainte-Justine.

P6:
Also in the mansion of the Count La Tourvelle.

P7:
It's always night-time in those places. That must be the work of evil!

P8:
I think something fell inside the village's well. If only I could climb down there and see...

P9:
You will need a flute to call the ferryman at Azur Lake.

P10:
Potions can be carried for later use. Food gets spoiled, though. It must be eaten imediatelly.

P11:
Welcome to the peaceful village of SAINT ANSELME.

Welcome to the inn
« Le chien de chasse ».

P16:
The GONDRE MINE is deep. It's far to the West near the border with the La Tourvelle Earldom.

P17:
You can record your adventure at the maid statues. There is one at the East end of the village.

P18:
In the Dark Forest there is a section covered by dead trees. That place creeps me out.

P19:
Some ropes are covered by thorns. You'd better have great gauntlets to climb them.

P20:
Welcome to my shop.

P21:
Come back whenever you need.

P22:
Hello! No refunds here. Choose wisely!

P23:
You will lose it if you find another one!

P24:
The Dark Forest is near the Azur Lake.

P25:
You found a SILVER FLUTE.

P26:
This is the mountain village of Isigny.

P27:
Beware! The ravens dwelling in this earldom during nighttime can be deadly!

P28:
There is an underground chapel in this village.

P29:
That chapel has become a dangerous place ever since a wall collapsed.

P30:
Behind the wall there is an entrance leading to the Rivoire Cave.

P31:
The Noyon Swamp is covered by a poisonous mist.

P32:
Don't enter that swamp without a suitable protection.

P33:
The castle of count La Tourvelle is replete with bird art.

P34:
It's also called the Birds' Castle.

P35:
Far to the west you will find the cemetery of Sarelle.

P36:
It's at the westernmost part of the duchy.

P37:
In the district of La Perdrix, invisible monsters roam freely during the night.

P38:
In the Isigny Plains you can find the tombstone of Heloise de La Tourvelle.

P39:
Word is that her spirit appears at dawn.

P40:
The weather beyond the crows' post is deadly cold. It can freeze you to death in a second!

P41:
In some places you can find a strange, red mist.

P42:
to It's likely that very tormented ghosts lurk nearby.

P43:
A strange bell noise can be heard at the Sarelle Cemetery.

P44:

Fall has arrived too early this year. This is quite weird.

P50:
The Delbasse City is the largest of the duchy.

P51:
St Justine convent is closed now.

P52:
When the demons revealed their true nature, the nuns fled.

P53: // !!!
One of the nuns said that Constance dâ€™Albaret has not left the convent.

P54:
At Hauteliard Lake you can contemplate the Albaret Castle.

P55:
The duke's castle is in Guernon Plains. It has been burned down some months ago.

P56:
The City Park is closed ever since a very strange plant appeared.

P57:
The scholars of the Guernon University were all killed.

P58:
Delbasse Park

P59:
People cannot leave the towns because of the monsters.

P60:
They are ransacking the duchy ever since the demons' revelation.

P61:
When Constance d'Albaret joined the nuns, a crucifix of the convent was stolen.

P62:
The Guernon University is beyond the Guernon Plains.

P63:
EAST-
Delbasse District

P64:
Welcome to the Delbasse Hotel.
 I'm sorry but all the rooms are occupied.

P65:
There are lugubrious people who often get upstairs.

P66:
They dress in black clothing, like in a funeral. It's a creepy sight.

P67:
Our rulers were demons. We're going to die!

P68:
Have you heard of a book called "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows"?

P69:
It was written by Aristide Torchia in Venice, 1666.

P70:
Almost all copies were burned by the Holy Inquisition, but 3 of these books still exist somewhere...

P71:
Some illustrations are signed by Torquia, while others are signed "LCF". I have no idea who "LCF" is. Maybe you can find out?

P72:
Beyond the bridge you will find a strange wasteland.
3 statues lie there.

P73:
A mysterious man came to the city some days ago. He was very handsome.

P74:
He had long, platinum hair, but appeared to be young. He was asking for information left and right.

P75:
He went to the St Justine Convent, if I'm not mistaken. What could he want on a place like this?

P76:
The Albaret Family and the Duke Henri de Guillecourt were demons.

P77:
The Albaret Castle is deserted and the Duke's one is destroyed.

P78:
Where are these families now, I wonder...

P79:
There are legends about a hidden castle. They say it was erected somewhere in this duchy.

P80:
Supposedly it would be a tribute to Lucifer, the Fallen Angel himself. Can you believe that?

P81:
So I tell you: I'm very familiar with the Guillecourt Duchy, and this legend is a bunch of nonsense.

P82:
You are Lecarde, aren't you? You must be that one who defeated the evil Von Viltheims.

P83:
I will tell you a very ironic story, then...

P84:
Did you know that 100 years ago, a Lecarde almost married a Von Viltheim dame called Anna?

P85:
The Lecarde fellow broke the engagement. She came to France but, in her desperation, committed suicide.

P86:
On her suicide letter she asked to be buried in her wedding dress.

P87:
What a sad end...

P88:
A young girl named Christine Chantrene has been taken by men wearing very strange clothes.

P89:
She has been taken away toward East. Her parents are broken down.

P90:
The weather is abnormally cold in the La Tourvelle Earldom.

P91:
It's still not fall, yet the trees in our earldom are shedding their leaves.

P92:
Also, some places of the duchy are trapped in perpetual night.

P93:
Everyone is scared of these unnatural occurrences. Can these be the End of Times...?

P94:
Welcome my Son to the House of God.

P95:
There is an horrendous plant in the City Park. Destroy it and then come back to me. I have something you might need.

P96:
Wonderful!

P97:
Take this item, it will help you.

P98:

P99:

P103:
Spirit of the night.. Come.. Come with us..

P104:
A young girl appeared and started speaking...

P105:
My heart.. My heart.. I need.. 100 hearts.
Please give me 100 hearts..

P106:
A young lad without his hands appeared and started speaking...

P107:
I'm no more than a thief. Please forgive me, Lady Albaret.
I will return your jewel immediately.

P108:
It seems that the spirits of the departed do not wish to join us...

P109:
You should buy a Broad Sword in the shop before venturing the Dark Forest ahead.

P110:
The monsters who live there are very dangerous.

P111:
Do not forget to equip the weapons and other items you may find or buy.
