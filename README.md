## Description
Source code of the fan-game Castlevania: The Lecarde Chronicles 2 made by Migami Games. Due to a HDD failure, the original source have been lost. This repo is an atempt to preserve, fix and improve this game.

Unfortunately, the recovery process ended up corrupting all non-English characters, many transparency effects and more. So, if you know any of the following languages and is interested in helping us out by fixing and re-translating this project, feel free to contact us, we are in need of:
- Someone who're both good at Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and good French speakers (preferably)
- Someone who're good at Clickteam Fusion 2.5


## Disclaimer
We contacted Migami Games and got approval to keep this repository up.  

The release of Lecarde Chronicles 2 got permitted by Konami, the game and its assets are freeware and **_SHOULD NOT_** be sold, this also includes the source code. Any modifications you do have also to be free. Castlevania is an intellectual property owned by Konami, please support the company by buying their official releases. 


## Usage

To get the reworked game builds, go to "Releases", choose the latest "v*. *. *-alpha" tag and find the .exe files in the "Game Binary" zipped file. The .exe file is the generated executable, while the .mfa file in "Source Code" zipped file fis the (recovered) Clickteam Fusion project file necessary to generate the .exe (note in this game's case, it requires some extensions from Clickteam Fusion 2.5 Developer builds to be opened). 

Note that the original game is infamous for the compatibility issue for PS4/Xbox controllers if your computers are unlucky so it left the controller preference blank. Here's a valid workaround to this issue if you encountered it like us:

In Control Panel→ Devices and printers, find PS4 controller (usually labeled as "Wireless Controller"), right click "Wireless Controller" label to find controller setting, then click "advance..." to go into advance setting of "Wireless Controller", and be sure the "Wireless Controller" is checked as the preference.

The same could be applied to Xbox Controllers by repeating the setup above while your desired Xbox controller is plugged in.

If your controller is NS type we cannot guarantee if it works 100% (too much problems with the game's bottom structure) but we provided baseline support and NS type controller label anyway.

It may or may not have something to do with system compatibility, but make sure you have all the font installed which the game demanded:

Arial Unicode MS (DX11)  
Baskerville Old Face (DX9)  
MS UI Gothic  
Tahoma   
Old English Text MT (DX9)  
Bookman Old Style (DX9)  
Californian FB  (DX9)  
新宋体 (DX9)  
黑体 (DX9)  

If some of the fonts did not get installed in you computer, the game will be unable to find them and thus cause problems.


#### System compatibility warning #### 

The game is only verified to be working as intended on windows revisions up until Windows 10 20H2 revision. 
Beyond that revison it's out of my control and nor will there be any hope of making compatibilities specifically for the unintended system (at least from me).

If any graphical glitch occurs, please make sure your Direct X 9 or Direct X 11 dependencies is correctly installed before report as a reproduce-able bug!!!


#### About "LC2_KeyBinding.ini" #### 
![20250409100627](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84dd9dd7-a641-4700-9e36-e246a3e2c3be)

A reworked version of the keyboard control created by DragonX24.
This file must be placed in the same directory the game locates if you downloaded the game and moved the game files to a fresh new location.

#### NEW Hotkey Functions #### 

- (At video setting screen) Toggle anti-alias on/off: F5/F6

To make the game display 1:1 pixel perfect scale:
- You must make sure the display monitor's vertical size is above 1000.
- You must make sure the windows display scale is exact 100%.
- Toggle anti-alias to off after opening the game.

#### About "Alternate build method" #### 

"Alternate build method" is done as an attempt to keep a small quirk away that the core plugin components of the game might be lost depending on player's local settings of firewalls, 
but on some situations it will cause antivirus flag to go mad so not recommended unless you want to go with loyalty and purity to vanilla.


#### About "Native Fullscreen resolution" #### 

Some players did not like the intended aspect ratio for preference reasons and prefer stretched fullscreen scale so this is provided as an alternated option. 



#### Read this if antivirus softwares flagged the game as Malware ####

![20250409100426](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf167b0d-96bf-4a37-ac36-0515f2281368)

It's something about Clickteam's engine itself. Antivirus softwares don't seem to be too kind towards some Games used Clickteam's engine. If the problem that the antivirus softwares flagged the game as malware occurs, either turn off the antivirus software in question, or add the game to its white list. Also avoid directly sharing the zips or folder(s) which contain the exe file unless really necessary because some net drive safety calculation like Google's, don't seem to be too happy with the game. 

#### Read this if your screen capture program did not work in Reworked LC2 ####
Some capture programs will have compatibility issue with reworked LC2 on Windows 10 (for example, Ocam). This is because the compatibility issue of some revisions of Windows 10's Direct X9 mode. If you want safe screen recording methods, more mainstream programs (like OBS) will work.


#### Read this if you encountered framerate problem in fullscreen mode #### 
It's something about your setting of VSync under Direct X 9 mode. If your only graphic device is a Nvidia GTX graphic card, toggle VSync in your Nvidia control panel to "fast" or "on" if you encountered frame rate problem in fullscreen mode.

#### Known bugs #### 
- If the game's project file is loaded through frame editor, quickly unfocus the game window by overlapping it with a larger window upon proceeding a frame change, when the next frame about to be loaded, the cursor will automatically move upwards. We tried multiple ways but cannot proceed bright results to rule out it. This shouldn't get in the way of normal gameplay on the generated .exes, though.

- If quickly unfocus the game window when holding a direction key at title menu, then focus back, the game's direction input will stuck. This is because the reworked game requires Control X plugin to sufficiently apply newly assigned Keyboard key input dynamically (in DragonX24's remodeled key assign formula) with the structure of such plugin is unfortunately too old and can generate issues with LC2 structure. Shouldn't get in the way of normal gameplay though.
